# TODO App
It is probably the destiny of every developer to build a todo app. I have also reached there and my aim is to build a todo app to learn about backend functionalities of:
- CRUD
- User Authentication and Authorization
- Basic Auth
- OAuth
- JWT tokens

## To run the app

Navigate to the route directory and run
```
nodemon index.js
```
